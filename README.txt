						Mario Terminal Game by Aaron Augustine


Required Packages: NumPy
		   Colorama


The game is based on the original Mario game by Nintendo made to play on terminal. Use W, A, D to move and jump as Mario. Kill the enemies
by jumping on them and collect coins to earn points and complete the stage. You only have one life so tread carefully. Colorama is used
to create a green effect reminiscent of the grass in the original game. Multiple colours were not used due to an issue with several print
statements impacting perfomance. Enjoy the sounds of the original game as well as a randomized map with almost totally random box placement.

Make sure your terminal is atleast 100 units wide and 35 units long.
